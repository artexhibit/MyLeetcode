## About

This repo is a collection of coding challenges that I have solved on the LeetCode platform using `Swift`.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and have a personal reference for problem-solving techniques and algorithms.

Inside you will find examples of how I approach and break down complex problems into manageable pieces.

## Repository Structure

Each solved problem is contained within its own Swift file for easy navigation and review. The files are named according to the problem number on LeetCode for quick reference.

## How to Use This Repository
